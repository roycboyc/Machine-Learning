This project was made as part of an Applied Machine Learning class with Serge Belongie

HW1:

1. Trained a k-nearest-neighbors algorithm to recognize sketches of digits and return identity of new digits in test set.
2. Trained a- algorithm on a list of Titanic passengers. Then, using demographics and type of cabin from the training dataset, the algorithm evaluated whether a hiterto-unseen list of passengers survived the Titanic disaster or not.
